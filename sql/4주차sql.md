```sql
SELECT I.ITEM_ID, I.ITEM_NAME

WHERE T.PARENT_ITEM_ID IS NULL

```sql
SELECT ROUTE,
CONCAT(ROUND(SUM(D_BETWEEN_DIST), 2), 'km') AS TOTAL_DISTANCE,
    CONCAT(ROUND(AVG(D_BETWEEN_DIST), 3), 'km') AS AVERAGE_DISTANCE
FROM SUBWAY_DISTANCE
GROUP BY ROUTE
ORDER BY TOTAL_DISTANCE DESC
```
ROUND를 넣으니까 km를 붙여야되고, km를 붙이려면 CONCAT를 써야하고, CONCAT까지 썼는데 안돼서 뭐지 싶었는데 ROUTE를 뺴먹은..



```sql
SELECT ID, NAME, HOST_ID
FROM PLACES
WHERE HOST_ID IN (
    SELECT HOST_ID
    FROM PLACES
    GROUP BY HOST_ID
    HAVING COUNT(*)>1)
ORDER BY ID;
